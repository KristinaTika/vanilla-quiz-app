## Quiz App

App is built using vanilla javaScript.

There are 2 sides of the app: 
1. Admin's
2. User's

1. Admin's name is Rick Grimes. If you log in as an admin, you'll be able to create, edit or delete questions, delete the list of the questions, delete a result or the whole scoreboard.

2. As a user, you can answer the questions. Before going to the next question, you'll see if your answer is correct or not. There is a progress bar as well. When you finish the quiz, you'll see your score.
